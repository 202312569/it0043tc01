                <div class="name">Ippo Makunochi</div>
                <div class="description">The main character of course must be on this list. For most of the first season, the series focuses on Ippo’s journey to the top of the country while other seasons focus on him being the champion of Japan in hopes he can get his fight with Miyata. Some may dispute he should be ranked higher than Miyata but considering that Miyata is champion of the pacific region gives him higher priority.</div>

                    <div class="name">Miyata Ichiro</div>
                    <div class="description">Ippo’s main rival and is also called Raijin, or the God of Lightning. As the son and protégé of a former Japan and Pacific Region champion, Miyata starts his own boxing career to finish what his father started, to prove his father’s style of out boxing of speed, footwork, and counters can defeat power. What derailed his father’s dreams was losing by way of knockout in the twelfth and final round of his seventh defense as the OPBF champion and having his jaw shattered in the process.</div>

                        <div class="description">Mashiba was a terrifying figure as soon as he was introduced and it was only compounded when he defeated Miyata in what was a shock to most watchers. Mashiba’s long reach ad fast jabs make it really hard for any of his opponents to get an offensive going and his dirty tactics makes that even harder.</div>

                <div class="name">Takamura</div>
                <div class="description">Takamura is undefeated in all of his professional bouts, this includes his match with Hawk. Takamura had his hardest fight with Hawk due to Hawk’s style. Takamura was able to push past this and defeat Hawk with solid boxing fundamentals, contrasting with Hawk’s lack of boxing skill.</div> </div>

            <div class="info">
                <div class="name">Sendo</div>
                <div class="description">Sendo is a dangerous in-fighter who has a ton of Knockout power. With his only losses being to the series’ main protagonist, and out side of a few other matches everything being a dominant performance, we have to put him on the list of strongest Hajime No Ippo characters.
